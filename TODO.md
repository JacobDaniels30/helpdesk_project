# Helpdesk Project Update Status

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Fixed Supabase filter syntax: All queries now use .eq() instead of .filter()
- [x] Fixed many-to-one relationship embedding: All tickets queries use explicit relationship names like categories!tickets_category_id_fkey
- [x] Removed unnecessary ticket_detail.html: File deleted, no longer needed
- [x] Unified dashboard UX: All dashboards show active/completed tickets, SLA/status info, category badges, agent names, urgency, timestamps consistently
- [x] View buttons unified: All "View" buttons in admin, agent, and user dashboards point to edit_ticket route
- [x] Admin dashboard keeps "Add Agent" button
- [x] Removed redundant ticket_detail route from app.py
- [x] Refactored db.py functions to use consistent .eq() and .select() calls
- [x] Added logging for query verification in welcome endpoint

## Current Status
- [x] Supabase queries updated to use .eq() and explicit relationships
- [x] Dashboard templates unified with consistent layout and functionality

- [ ] Test agent dashboard flow: Login as agent → check tickets page
- [ ] Test View/Edit buttons: Click View/Edit on tickets → should go directly to edit_ticket page
- [ ] Test ticket edits: Confirm ticket edits save correctly and return to dashboard
- [ ] Verify category embedding works correctly in all queries
- [ ] Verify no .filter() calls remain in codebase
